As we have four pages that all apply to albums, we will group 
them in a single controller AlbumController within our Album 
module as four actions. The four actions will be:

Action 	            Controller 	            Page

Home 	            AlbumController 	    index
Add new album 	    AlbumController 	    add
Edit album 	        AlbumController 	    edit
Delete album 	    AlbumController 	    delete

The mapping of a URL to a particular action is done using 
routes that are defined in the moduleâ€™s module.config.php file. 
We will add a route for our album actions.

URL 	            Page 	                        Action      Method called
/album 	            Home (list of albums) 	        index       Album\Controller\AlbumController::indexAction
/album/add 	        Add new album 	                add         Album\Controller\AlbumController::addAction
/album/edit/2 	    Edit album with an id of 2 	    edit        Album\Controller\AlbumController::editAction
/album/delete/4 	Delete album with an id of 4 	delete      Album\Controller\AlbumController::deleteAction
